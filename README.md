# Ilseon: Priority Focus

**Ilseon** (일선, Korean for _“front line”_ or _“immediate priority”_) is a minimalist executive function 
assistant designed to reduce mental overload. It creates a protected focus environment that helps users 
with **ADD/ADHD** and **ASD** regain control over time, attention, and priorities.

## The Core Problem

Traditional productivity apps assume users can manage endless lists and switch contexts freely. 
But for neurodivergent users, this often leads to **context-switching burnout**, **time blindness**, and **task paralysis**.
Ilseon tackles this by **filtering focus**, showing only one Context at a time (e.g. _Work_, _Family_, _Project 1_). 
When you’re in a given context, everything else disappears. The goal is to reduce cognitive noise, 
so your attention stays anchored on what matters _right now_.

## How It Works

* **Context Filtering**: Choose one life context, and all unrelated tasks are hidden.
* **Single Priority View**: The dashboard displays only your current or next task; the one thing that needs your attention.
* **Quick Capture**: A floating action button opens an instant input screen for adding tasks in seconds, helping you externalise thoughts before they become mental clutter.
* **Gentle Reminders**: Time-based notifications use vibration and visual cues instead of noisy alerts to respect sensory sensitivity.

## Tech Stack

* **Language**: Kotlin
* **UI Toolkit:** Jetpack Compose (Modern, declarative, and visually minimalist)
* **Data Persistence**: Room (SQLite Abstraction for robust local data)
* **Scheduling**: Android AlarmManager (Reliable time-based reminders)

## Design Principles

1.	**Simplicity is Success**: Less is more — whitespace, quiet colours, and clean typography.
2.	**Focus First**: Only one visible task to combat overwhelm and indecision.
3.	**Low Sensory Load**: Dark, muted themes as default. No flashing elements or visual noise.
4.	**Instant Capture**: The path from “I thought of something” to “It’s safely saved” should take less than two seconds.

## Vision

**Ilseon** is a **cognitive offloading tool** designed for neurodivergent users who need less friction, not more features. 
Its purpose is simple: help you reclaim your front line of focus, one context at a time.
